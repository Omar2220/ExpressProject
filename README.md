# ExpressProject

*Project Idea*

#### This is a small project that displays some of the Express framework.
The idea behind this project is pretty simple , I had to do a project (built from 0 of course) in which I display what I've learnd in the past few weeks at WebAhead program.
So first I really had no Idea what to do and how to start , and I knew I had to learn about the Express framework all alone beacause there was a holiday in the country and we didn't manage to go through the workshops in class, so I started to learn and read about it and then I realised that maybe there are others like me.
It wasn't easy to apply what I've learned and understand it deeply , so I did a project (backend until now) which displays some of the useful Express features along with some other great tools that I end up working with thanks to self-learning process (so maybe it's not that bad to self-learn after all :sweat_smile:).
